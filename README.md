# CS344-Project2 I/O Elevators

Requirement:
This is an elevator algorithm
Choose either both directions of travel or only servicing in one direction (LOOK or C-LOOK)
There will be at least 2 sorts involved.
Don't forget to MERGE. Either front or back, not both.
#:I really hope you actually did look up the different options for qemu, as you'll need to make a change this time to get your IO scheduler to be used.
